## Use %prefix% for the Prefix given below. ##
## Use %target_name% for the person you give autominer-time. ##
## Use %autominer_time% to say how many Seconds, Minutes, Hours or Days of autominer-time the person gets. ##
## Use %autominer_time_left% to say how much time you have left in your autominer. ##
## Use %timeused% to say how long the person was in the autominer on leave. ##
## Use %playerautominertimeleft% to say how long the player has left in their autominer on leave. ##

## All of the placeholders above work in the messages where they are in right now (means %autominer_time_left% doesn't work in 'TimeGivenSeconds')  ##
